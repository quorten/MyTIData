This is MyTIData, what else needs to be said?  Okay, so quite a bit.
First of all, TI is short for TI-83, TI-84, TI-89, TI-nn, etc... these
are the names of graphing calculators manufactured by Texas
Instruments.  At the time of the late 2000s, these were pretty popular
in U.S. high schools, and Texas Instruments basically held a monopoly
over graphing calculators for middle school and high school math
education in the United States.

Calculator games were very popular at the time, and in effect used as
a way around school rules against electronic handheld gaming
devices... I mean, if everyone has a graphing calculator as required
for school use, what social and political issues are there to worry
about?  For me, I tried my hand at doing some of my own programming
for the TI-89 Titanium graphing calculator.

My principal tool for doing this development was TIGCC.  Basically, it
is a port of GCC to allow for easily cross-compiling C programs to
target the TI-89 calculator.
